		<h1> Need a half way meeting point? </h1>
		<p>With Treff find a half way point quick and easy.<br/> Treff will ask to go your
		   location via geolocation or address you enter. Then you can use an email or
		   phone number to invite who you want to meet. An invitation will be sent to them
		   while keeping your and their start location private.</p>
		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h4>What's a Treff?</h4> <p>If you speak German you know the answer.</p>
        <h4>Why name it Treff?</h4> <p> Because it sounds cool.</p>
        <h4>Will the person I'm meeting see the information I enter?</h4> <p> Not at all. We only use your location in order to take the guess work out of finding a public meeting space.</p>
		<h4>How do I know the invitation was sent?</h4> <p> There will be a confirmation page that the message was sent.</p>
		<h4>What happens if they receive an invitation?</h4> <p> Once they receive your invitation they will have a chance to enter their location. Then a public halfway point will be found using Goggle Maps.</p>
		<h4>Is your meeting algorithm public?</h4> <p> Sorry in order to prevent "gaming" the meeting place we hold it under lock and key.</p>
